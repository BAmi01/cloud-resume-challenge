# cloud-resume-challenge

In this project I will be diving into Forrest Brazel's Cloud Resume Challenge; not only to host my resume on it's own website but to also give myself a hands on refresher. As I work to transition from the education field into tech, I believe this will be a great opportunity for me to be grounded and confident in my cloud knowledge and abilities. 

Tech Stack I Will Be Working With: Python, HTML, CSS, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, Javascript, Amazon Route 53, DynamoDB, AWS API Gateway, CI/CD Pipeline, AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)-CLI, and GitHub.
